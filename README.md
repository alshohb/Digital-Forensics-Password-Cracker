# Password Recovery System

## Project Overview
The Password Recovery System is designed to securely generate and recover passwords using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. This project demonstrates the implementation of salted hash generation and the brute-force recovery of passwords, showcasing the application's efficiency and security.

## Features
- **Password Input**: Accepts a four-character password from the user.
- **Salt Generation**: Automatically generates a random 16-character salt.
- **Hash Generation**: Produces a secure hash using SHA-256.
- **Password Recovery**: Employs a brute-force method to recover the original password.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

Python 3.8 or higher


### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/alshohb/Digital-Forensics-Password-Cracker.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Digital-Forensics-Password-Cracker

3. Run the script:
python password_recovery.py


## Usage
Run the script and follow the on-screen prompts to enter a password and view the hashed output and recovery process.

## System Design
The system design is outlined with the following diagram, illustrating the process flow from user input to password recovery:
