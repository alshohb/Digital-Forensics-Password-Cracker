# Password Recovery System

## Project Overview
The Password Recovery System is designed to securely generate and recover passwords using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. This project demonstrates the implementation of salted hash generation and the brute-force recovery of passwords, showcasing the application's efficiency and security.

## Features
- **Password Input**: Accepts a four-character password from the user.
- **Salt Generation**: Automatically generates a random 16-character salt.
- **Hash Generation**: Produces a secure hash using SHA-256.
- **Password Recovery**: Employs a brute-force method to recover the original password.
